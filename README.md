This is a simple User Interface.

It uses cryptogecko API to retrieve information about 100 cryptocurrencies. ALthough we only display 20 of them, users are still able to use the search bar to find the crypto they are looking for.
The detainView contains the current price and the percentage change over 24 hours. The change will be displayed in green if larger than or equal to 0 and red otherwise.

Listrow shows the crypto in each row on the contentView. It displays the image then name. 

This UI has a lot of room for improvement.

1. I'd like to add a loading wheel.
2. More details about the cryptocurrency, like marketcap, trading volume etc.
3. Ideally I would show a chart. Though that may be quite difficult to achieve.
